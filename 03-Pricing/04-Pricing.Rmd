# Institutional background

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)

---
# Now
As we know, we now spend <b>a lot</b> on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices (and a big part of that is hospital prices)

# Hospital prices in real life
We'll get into the real data in a bit, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive

2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas

3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?<br>

--

From an economics perspective:
- Hospital assumed to maximize some objective function, $u(q,z)$, subject to a production constraint

- $q$ denotes quantity of care and $z$ denotes quality of care

- Production is constrained by the break-even condition

---
# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?<br>

--

From a practical perspective:
- Profits must be re-invested into the hospital

- Must show "community benefit" (no consensus definition...includes uncompensated care, services to Medicaid, and certain specialized services that are generally unprofitable)

- No taxes! and tax-free bonds

---
# Non-profit hospitals and tax benefits
- <span>&#36;</span>24.6 billion in tax exemptions in 2011

- <span>&#36;</span>62.4 billion in "community benefits"<br>

- [Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/value-of-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals-doubled-in-a-decade/2015/06/17/4162c640-1450-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?utm_term=.4f877a72a09f)<br>

--

What do you think? Are these community benefits measured appropriately?


---
# What is a non-profit hospital?
The real question is...what is the hospital's objective function?

- For-profit in disguise
- Output maximizers
- Tax-benefit maximizers
- Social welfare maximizers<br>

--

Most empirical evidence doesn't find much of a difference between FP and NFP hospitals, except FPs have higher prices. Why is that?


---
# For-profit hospitals
These are easier to study theoretically...just a standard profit maximizing firm.

- $\pi=P(q)q - C(q),$ where $q$ denotes quantity of care

- Firm has some market power and so faces a downward sloping demand curve

# Pricing and Negotiations

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>


---
# Pricing for NFP hospitals
Objective is to maximize some function of profits and quantity of care provided, denoted by<br>

$U\left( \pi_{j} = \pi_{i,j} + \pi_{g,j},D_{i,j}, D_{g,j} \right)$<br>

where $\pi_{j}$ denotes total profits for hospital $j$ and $D_{i,j}$ denotes hospital demand from insurer $i$. We assume that $p_{j}$ is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, $p_{i}$.

---
# Solution for NFP hospital
The hospital chooses $p_{i}$ such that<br>

$\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0$,<br>

where $U_{1}$ denotes the derivative of $U(\cdot)$ with respect to its first argument and similarly for $U_{2}$.<br>

--

In general, we can't solve this directly without knowing the hospital's utility function.

# Example

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=16-q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5+q^{2}$. Where will the firm produce and at what price? What is the firm's markup over marginal cost?

--
The profit function is, $\pi = (16-q)q - 5 - q^{2}$. Differentiating with respect to quantity yields $-q + 16 - q - 2q= 16-4q=0$, or $q=4$. At this quantity, the price is $p=12$, which is a markup of 4 over the marginal cost (or 50% markup).

---
# In-class problem (unilateral pricing)

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=40-2q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5q+\frac{1}{2}q^{2}$. 

1. What is the firm's profit maximizing choice of quantity and price? 
2. What is the markup over marginal cost?

---
# Negotiating with insurers
- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Negotiation with insurers
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

---
# Understanding the outside option
Key part of understanding effect on price is to understand the "outside option". What does this mean?<br>

--

Outside option in this case is the profit to the hospital or insurer if a negotiation "breaks down". What is the outside option to an insurer if they are in a monopoly hospital market?

---
# Nash Bargaining problem
We model this bargaining problem as a "Nash bargaining" problem.
- Two people are faced with a negotiation
- If they agree, each gets payoffs $u_{1}$ $u_{2}$, respectively
- If they disagree, each gets some other payoff, $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, with $u_{1} > t_{1}$ and $u_{2} > t_{2}$ 
- Nash showed that the solution is $\max (u_{1}- t_{1})(u_{2} - t_{2})$


---
# In-class problem (Nash bargaining)
Assume that two agents are negotiating over how best to divide their quantity of good x, which is normalized to 1. If the players reach an agreement, player 1 receives utility $u_{1} = x$, and player 2 receives utility $u_{2} = (1-x)$. If the players do not reach an agreement, player 1 receives a payoff of $t1 = 0$, and
player 2 receives payoff $t_{2} = a > 0$.<br>

1. Find the Nash bargaining solution to this game.
2. Explain how this solution varies with $a$.


---
# Hospital competition
At least 2 related issues in studying hospital competitiveness:
1. How do we measure "competitiveness"?
2. What is the effect of competition?

---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>

# Fixed Prices

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>


---
# Types of fixed prices
- Health care providers also face a fixed price from Medicare and Medicaid
- Variation across hospitals, but hospital has no control over it's individual price


---
# Background on Medicare
- Created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally health insurance to those 65 years of age and older
- Expanded to include certain disabilities (20% now below age 65)
- Consists of four parts:
  1. Part A: Hospital Insurance
  2. Part B: "Medical" Insurance (physician visits and outpatient care)
  3. Part C: Private supplemental care (Medicare plus Choice, now Medicare Advantage)
  4. Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage

---
# Medicare Part A
- Automatic enrollment for anyone 65 and older who worked over their lifetime
- Financed with combination of payroll tax (current workers) and cost-sharing (deductibles, etc.)
- Funds exist as part of "Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund"...can't finance through debt
- Benefit structure:
  - Very good for short inpatient stays
  - Very bad for major problems with long stays
  - Doesn't cover nursing home care beyond 30 days

---
# Medicare Part B
- Voluntary, but almost everyone enrolls
- Requires monthly premium ($144 in 2020)
- Small deductible and 20% co-insurance


---
# Medicare Part C
- Private insurance provision of Medicare benefits
- Formally created under Balanced Budget Act in 1997 (existed informally before)
- Heavily revised in Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Medicare pays insurers a risk-adjusted amount to enroll a given beneficiary
- Broader benefits than Part A and B, often with $0 additional premiums, but restrictive networks

---
# Medicare Part D
- Created under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Private insurance for prescription drugs
- Insurers receive payments from Medicare to enroll a given beneificiary (much like Part C)
- Many insurers offer a combined Part C+D plan

---
# Privatization of Medicare
- Medicare Advantage (both Parts C and D) has been well-received and generally thought to be a success story for Medicare benefits
- Accounts for nearly 40% of total Medicare enrollees
- Some early difficulties with adverse selection and risk-adjustment
- Still slightly sicker people staying in traditional Medicare
- Could be a <b>big</b> part of any future "Medicare-for-all" type program

---
# Medicare payments
- Prospective payment system
- Begin with two "base" rates:
  - Operating base payment rates, <span>&#36;</span>5,797 in 2020
  - Capital base payment rates, <span>&#36;</span>462 in 2020
- Adjustments:
  - Diagnosis Related Group (higher adjustments for more complicated things)
  - Academic Medical Center
  - Disproportionate Share


---
# Background on Medicaid
- Also created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally provided health insurance to people receiving "Aid to Families with Dependent Children", mainly extremely poor families
- Expanded over time with different rules by state
- Huge program: about 40% of births are covered by Medicaid/CHIP and 1 in 3 birhts!

---
# ACA and Medicaid Expansion
- Big part of ACA was Medicaid expansion
- Originally mandatory but made voluntary by Supreme Court
- Expansion covers all adults (with or without children) below age 65 and with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line ($35,535 for family of 4 in 2020)
  
---
# Medicaid Funding
- Paid for by states and federal funding
- State funding is matched by federal funds, and the match amount depends on the state's per capita income
- Incentivizes services to be provided by Medicaid that historically may not be

---
# Medicaid Benefits
- Pretty generous coverage
- Low to no copayments, deductibles, co-insurance
- Usually covers dental, vision, hospitals, and physician services
- Covers long term care (unlike Medicare). About 40% of all long term care is paid for by Medicaid.
- Growth in Medicaid managed care

---
# Medicaid Payments
- Works similarly to Medicare with a base rate plus adjustments
- Base rates vary by state Medicaid agencies
- Adjustments (or supplemental payments) consist of:
  - Disproportionate share adjustments 
  - Other (non-DSH) adjustments
  - Account for a little less than half of total Medicaid payments on average

# In-class problem (two-price market)

# Cost-shifting
- Relationship between public and private price is important
- Speaks to anticipated effects of a change in Medicaid or Medicare rates
- Do hospitals "make up" the difference?<br>

--

The idea that hospitals will increase private prices following a decrease in the public price is called <b>cost shifting</b>. 

---
# Cost-shifting
But how could it happen?<br>

--

Assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example:
- Hospital has very low margins (maybe negative with a lower public price)
- Insurer wants to prop up the hospital for competitive reasons
- Hospital has diminishing returns to profits<br>

--

but economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers.

# Institutional background

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)

---
# Now
As we know, we now spend <b>a lot</b> on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices (and a big part of that is hospital prices)

# What is a hospital price?

Lots of different payers paying lots of different prices:
- [Medicare fee-for-service prices](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AcutePaymtSysfctsht.pdf)
- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

# Hospital prices in real life
We'll get into the real data in a bit, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive

2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas

3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?<br>

--

From an economics perspective:
- Hospital assumed to maximize some objective function, $u(q,z)$, subject to a production constraint

- $q$ denotes quantity of care and $z$ denotes quality of care

- Production is constrained by the break-even condition

---
# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?<br>

--

From a practical perspective:
- Profits must be re-invested into the hospital

- Must show "community benefit" (no consensus definition...includes uncompensated care, services to Medicaid, and certain specialized services that are generally unprofitable)

- No taxes! and tax-free bonds

---
# Non-profit hospitals and tax benefits
- <span>&#36;</span>24.6 billion in tax exemptions in 2011

- <span>&#36;</span>62.4 billion in "community benefits"<br>

- [Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/value-of-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals-doubled-in-a-decade/2015/06/17/4162c640-1450-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?utm_term=.4f877a72a09f)<br>

--

What do you think? Are these community benefits measured appropriately?


---
# What is a non-profit hospital?
The real question is...what is the hospital's objective function?

- For-profit in disguise
- Output maximizers
- Tax-benefit maximizers
- Social welfare maximizers<br>

--

Most empirical evidence doesn't find much of a difference between FP and NFP hospitals, except FPs have higher prices. Why is that?


---
# For-profit hospitals
These are easier to study theoretically...just a standard profit maximizing firm.

- $\pi=P(q)q - C(q),$ where $q$ denotes quantity of care

- Firm has some market power and so faces a downward sloping demand curve

# Pricing and Negotiations

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>


---
# Pricing for NFP hospitals
Objective is to maximize some function of profits and quantity of care provided, denoted by<br>

$U\left( \pi_{j} = \pi_{i,j} + \pi_{g,j},D_{i,j}, D_{g,j} \right)$<br>

where $\pi_{j}$ denotes total profits for hospital $j$ and $D_{i,j}$ denotes hospital demand from insurer $i$. We assume that $p_{j}$ is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, $p_{i}$.

---
# Solution for NFP hospital
The hospital chooses $p_{i}$ such that<br>

$\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0$,<br>

where $U_{1}$ denotes the derivative of $U(\cdot)$ with respect to its first argument and similarly for $U_{2}$.<br>

--

In general, we can't solve this directly without knowing the hospital's utility function.

# Example

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=16-q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5+q^{2}$. Where will the firm produce and at what price? What is the firm's markup over marginal cost?

--
The profit function is, $\pi = (16-q)q - 5 - q^{2}$. Differentiating with respect to quantity yields $-q + 16 - q - 2q= 16-4q=0$, or $q=4$. At this quantity, the price is $p=12$, which is a markup of 4 over the marginal cost (or 50% markup).

---
# In-class problem (unilateral pricing)

Consider the firm's demand curve, $d=40-2q$, and cost curve, $c(q)=5q+\frac{1}{2}q^{2}$. 

1. What is the firm's profit maximizing choice of quantity and price? 
2. What is the markup over marginal cost?

---
# Negotiating with insurers
- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Negotiation with insurers
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

---
# Understanding the outside option
Key part of understanding effect on price is to understand the "outside option". What does this mean?<br>

--

Outside option in this case is the profit to the hospital or insurer if a negotiation "breaks down". What is the outside option to an insurer if they are in a monopoly hospital market?

---
# Nash Bargaining problem
We model this bargaining problem as a "Nash bargaining" problem.
- Two people are faced with a negotiation
- If they agree, each gets payoffs $u_{1}$ $u_{2}$, respectively
- If they disagree, each gets some other payoff, $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, with $u_{1} > t_{1}$ and $u_{2} > t_{2}$ 
- Nash showed that the solution is $\max (u_{1}- t_{1})(u_{2} - t_{2})$


---
# In-class problem (Nash bargaining)
Assume that two agents are negotiating over how best to divide their quantity of good x, which is normalized to 1. If the players reach an agreement, player 1 receives utility $u_{1} = x$, and player 2 receives utility $u_{2} = (1-x)$. If the players do not reach an agreement, player 1 receives a payoff of $t1 = 0$, and
player 2 receives payoff $t_{2} = a > 0$.<br>

1. Find the Nash bargaining solution to this game.
2. Explain how this solution varies with $a$.


---
# Hospital competition
At least 2 related issues in studying hospital competitiveness:
1. How do we measure "competitiveness"?
2. What is the effect of competition?

---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>

# Fixed Prices

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>


---
# Types of fixed prices
- Health care providers also face a fixed price from Medicare and Medicaid
- Variation across hospitals, but hospital has no control over it's individual price


---
# Background on Medicare
- Created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally health insurance to those 65 years of age and older
- Expanded to include certain disabilities (20% now below age 65)
- Consists of four parts:
  1. Part A: Hospital Insurance
  2. Part B: "Medical" Insurance (physician visits and outpatient care)
  3. Part C: Private supplemental care (Medicare plus Choice, now Medicare Advantage)
  4. Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage

---
# Medicare Part A
- Automatic enrollment for anyone 65 and older who worked over their lifetime
- Financed with combination of payroll tax (current workers) and cost-sharing (deductibles, etc.)
- Funds exist as part of "Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund"...can't finance through debt
- Benefit structure:
  - Very good for short inpatient stays
  - Very bad for major problems with long stays
  - Doesn't cover nursing home care beyond 30 days

---
# Medicare Part B
- Voluntary, but almost everyone enrolls
- Requires monthly premium ($144 in 2020)
- Small deductible and 20% co-insurance


---
# Medicare Part C
- Private insurance provision of Medicare benefits
- Formally created under Balanced Budget Act in 1997 (existed informally before)
- Heavily revised in Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Medicare pays insurers a risk-adjusted amount to enroll a given beneficiary
- Broader benefits than Part A and B, often with $0 additional premiums, but restrictive networks

---
# Medicare Part D
- Created under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Private insurance for prescription drugs
- Insurers receive payments from Medicare to enroll a given beneificiary (much like Part C)
- Many insurers offer a combined Part C+D plan

---
# Privatization of Medicare
- Medicare Advantage (both Parts C and D) has been well-received and generally thought to be a success story for Medicare benefits
- Accounts for nearly 40% of total Medicare enrollees
- Some early difficulties with adverse selection and risk-adjustment
- Still slightly sicker people staying in traditional Medicare
- Could be a <b>big</b> part of any future "Medicare-for-all" type program

---
# Medicare payments
- Prospective payment system
- Begin with two "base" rates:
  - Operating base payment rates, <span>&#36;</span>5,797 in 2020
  - Capital base payment rates, <span>&#36;</span>462 in 2020
- Adjustments:
  - Diagnosis Related Group (higher adjustments for more complicated things)
  - Academic Medical Center
  - Disproportionate Share


---
# Background on Medicaid
- Also created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally provided health insurance to people receiving "Aid to Families with Dependent Children", mainly extremely poor families
- Expanded over time with different rules by state
- Huge program: about 40% of births are covered by Medicaid/CHIP and 1 in 3 birhts!

---
# ACA and Medicaid Expansion
- Big part of ACA was Medicaid expansion
- Originally mandatory but made voluntary by Supreme Court
- Expansion covers all adults (with or without children) below age 65 and with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line ($35,535 for family of 4 in 2020)
  
---
# Medicaid Funding
- Paid for by states and federal funding
- State funding is matched by federal funds, and the match amount depends on the state's per capita income
- Incentivizes services to be provided by Medicaid that historically may not be

---
# Medicaid Benefits
- Pretty generous coverage
- Low to no copayments, deductibles, co-insurance
- Usually covers dental, vision, hospitals, and physician services
- Covers long term care (unlike Medicare). About 40% of all long term care is paid for by Medicaid.
- Growth in Medicaid managed care

---
# Medicaid Payments
- Works similarly to Medicare with a base rate plus adjustments
- Base rates vary by state Medicaid agencies
- Adjustments (or supplemental payments) consist of:
  - Disproportionate share adjustments 
  - Other (non-DSH) adjustments
  - Account for a little less than half of total Medicaid payments on average

# Relationship between prices

1. A price fixed by Medicare and Medicaid, $p_{m}$.
2. A price that is negotiated with insurers, $p_{n}$.

How does $p_{m}$ affect $p_{n}$?<br>

# Two price market and NFP
Although we don't know the general solution for the private price, we can find how it varies with the public price...<br>

# In-class problem (two-price market)
Consider the firm's demand curve in the private insurance market, $d=16-q$, and costs, $c(q)=5+q^{2}$. Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of $\bar{p}=10$.<br>

1. How many private patients will the provider serve? 
2. How many public patients? 
3. What if $\bar{p}$ drops to <span>&#36;</span>9.

---
# Cost-shifting
- Relationship between public and private price is important
- Speaks to anticipated effects of a change in Medicaid or Medicare rates
- Do hospitals "make up" the difference?<br>

--

The idea that hospitals will increase private prices following a decrease in the public price is called <b>cost shifting</b>. 

---
# Cost-shifting
But how could it happen?<br>

--

Assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example:
- Hospital has very low margins (maybe negative with a lower public price)
- Insurer wants to prop up the hospital for competitive reasons
- Hospital has diminishing returns to profits<br>

--

but economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers.
