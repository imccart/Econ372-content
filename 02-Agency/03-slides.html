# Wasteful?
- Estimates are that more than 30% of health care expenditures are "wasteful": [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)

- Some clear areas of waste:
  - Payment differentials by location of treatment (policy quirks)
  - Better imaging with little benefit
  - Proton treatment (for some conditions)
  - Heart stents
  - Arthroscopic knee surgery&lt;br&gt;

Many estimates of "waste" are after-the-fact. It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)

# Physician Agency

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

# Definition

Physicians are better informed about treatment decisions than patients, and so there exists some &lt;b&gt;agency&lt;/b&gt; relationship between the two. For many conditions, patients can't treat themselves even if they wanted to.

---
# Setup
- Denote quantity of physician services by `\(x\)`

- Denote benefit of services to patient by `\(B(x)\)`

- Patients pay (and physicians receive) a price of `\(p\)` for each unit of service `\(x\)`

- Physicians incur cost `\(c\)` for each unit of care

- Net benefit to patients is `\(NB(x)=B(x)-px\)`

- Physicians must choose quantity of care at least better than the patient's outside option, `\(NB(x)= B(x)-px \geq NB^{0}\)`.


---
# Solving the model
With this framework, how much care will be provided? (i.e., what is the optimal value of `\(x\)`) &lt;br&gt;

--

Solve the model in two steps:&lt;br&gt;

1. Physician will provide minimum surplus to keep the patient, `\(NB(x) = B(x)-px = NB^{0}\)`

2. Substitute into physician profit function, `\(\pi=(p-c)x = B(x)-NB^{0} - cx\)`, and solve for `\(x\)`&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Note: this approach applies when prices and quantity of care are variable. If the physician cannot set price, then we just work off of the constraint, `\(B(x)-\bar{p}x=NB^{0}\)`. 

---
# In-class Problem: Physician agency
Denote the quantity of care consumed by `\(x\)`, and denote by `\(B(x)\)` the function that determines the benefit of care to the patient. Assume that the patient must pay the full price of care, `\(px\)`, so that their net benefit is `\(NB=B(x)−px\)`. Further assume that the physician can choose both `\(x\)` and `\(p\)`.  

1. Find the patient’s optimal `\(x\)`.
2. Draw the marginal benefit on a graph and note the price and patient's optimal quantity.
3. Find the physician's optimal `\(x\)` assuming `\(NB^{0}=0\)`. 
4. Add the physician's optimal `\(x\)` to your graph and interpret the difference.


---
# Physician agency in a graph
&lt;img src="03-slides_files/figure-html/tikz-agency-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Example
Assume `\(B(x)=8x^{1/2}\)`, `\(NB^{0}=2\)`, and `\(c=1\)`:&lt;br&gt;

1. Find the physician's optimal level of `\(x\)` and `\(p\)`.
2. Find the patient's optimal level of `\(x\)`.
3. Draw this graphically.

---
# Answer
First let's re-write the constraint such that `\(px = 8x^{1/2}\)` and `\(\pi = 8x^{1/2} - 2 - x\)`. The first order condition for `\(x\)` is then `\(4x^{-1/2} -1 =0\)`, which is satisfied at `\(x^{*}=16\)`. Substituting this into the constraint, `\(8x^{1/2} - px=2\)` yields `\(p=\frac{15}{8}\)`. 


But if they could choose on their own, the patient would prefer to maximize their net benefit. This would occur at `\(4x^{-1/2}=p\)`, which yields `\(x=(32/15)^{2} \approx 4.5\)` at `\(p=15/8\)`.


---
# Example with fixed price
An increase in the administratively set price leads to a &lt;b&gt;decrease&lt;/b&gt; in quantity of services provided. And vice versa, a reduction in price leads to an &lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt; in quantity provided. Why?

--
`$$\begin{align*}
b(x)\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} - x - p\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} = \frac{-x}{p-b(x)} &amp;&lt; 0.
\end{align*}$$`

---
# In-class Problem: Agency and fixed prices

Assume `\(B(x)=4x^{1/2}\)`, `\(NB^{0}=0\)`, anc `\(c=1\)`. Further assume that prices are fixed administratively at, `\(\bar{p}=2\)`. Note that, in this case, we work only off of the patient's net benefit constraint.

1. What is the physician's and patient's optimal amount of care provided?
2. The government is considering increasing the price to `\(\bar{p}=3\)`. What are the new optimal levels of care for physicians and patients at this new price?
3. How would the price change affect the difference between the patient and physician's optimal amounts?

---
# Agency with capitated payments

- Physician receives fixed ("capitated") amount for each patient, `\(R\)`, along with some price per unit of service, `\(p_{s}\)`

- Physician therefore paid `\(R + (p_{s} - c)x\)` for each patient

- Number of patients for each physician expressed as a positive function of the net benefit offered, `\(n(NB)\)`, where `\(NB=B(x) - p_{d}x\)`. Here, we assume that the insurer sets `\(p_{d}\)` and `\(p_{s}\)` separately (the demand and supply price, respectively).

- Physician again aims to maximize profits, `\(\pi=n(NB)\left[R+(p_{s}-c)x\right]\)`.


---
# Solution with capitated payments
Maximizing the profit function yields:&lt;br&gt;
`\(n'(NB)(B'(x) - p_{d}) \left[R + (p_{s} - c)x \right] + n(NB)(p_{s}-c) = 0\)`.&lt;br&gt;

Rearranging terms and multiplying both sides by `\(\frac{1}{NB}\)`, we get:&lt;br&gt;
`\(\frac{B'(x) - p_{d}}{NB} \frac{R + (p_{s} - c)x}{p_{s}-c} = - \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n,NB}}\)`

--

1. What happens for `\(R=0\)`?
2. What about `\(R&gt;0\)`, assuming `\(p_{s}&lt;c\)`?


---
# Takeaways
Excessive treatment may arise because physicians can choose a level of care, and this choice may derive from incentives that are not perfectly aligned with those of the patients. From this section, you should be able to:&lt;br&gt;

1. Set up and solve the physician's optimization problem and compare the solution to that of the patient's optimum.
2. Show mathematically how the design of an insurance contract (namely, capitated payments versus fee-for-service payments) may determine the extent to which physicians overprovide care.
