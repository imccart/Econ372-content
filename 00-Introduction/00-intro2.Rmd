# Health Care and Economics (in General)
Lots of interesting economic issues in health care (not all unique to the U.S.):

--

1. Extremely heterogeneous products
2. Asymmetric information between patients and physicians
3. Unobservable quality (experience good)
4. Unpredictable need (inability to shop in many cases)
5. Distortion of incentives due to insurance
6. Adverse selection (asymmetric information between patients and insurers)

???
Can you list some ways that the U.S. health care system is "unique" as an area of economic study?

---
# How is the U.S. unique
- These factors exist in other markets and in other countries, but...
- Health care is unique in the combination of these issues
- U.S. is unique in the extent of these issues in health care (policy problems)


---
# Why?

Can you identify one or two reasons for our high prices/expenditures? Keep in mind we don't have a particularly strong quality advantage either.


???
- Do this as a zoom poll: What do you think is the biggest driver of spending? Too much care? Overpaid physicians? Less healthy population?

---
# Why is spending so high?

???
We saw some of these same ideas in the commonwealth fund graphs. For example, we saw in those graphs that we don't use more health care than in other countries (at least, when measured by number of physician visits)

---
# Fragmentation
A common criticism of U.S. health care is that it is extremely fragmented:
- different ways to get insurance
- mix of providers and reliance on referrals
- separate billing (for the most part)

---
# Complicated bills
Our fragmented system has led to a ridiculously complex and convoluted billing process

???
How much is an accu-chek test strip on Amazon? Give everyone time to look it up.

---
# Complicated bills
- $18 for accu-chek test strip (in 2011)
- Can get 50 for $11.44 on Amazon<br>

--
<br>

Note: this $18 is a charge, which is different from price or cost...much more on this later


---
# What did we learn?
1. We spend *LOTS* on health care, the most in the world by far
2. Definitely not the highest quality health care system in the world
3. Many reasons:
  - Standard health economics issues
  - Fragmented system
  - Market-based system but without real competition
  - Policy failures
4. What's the solution?<br>

Take this class!!
