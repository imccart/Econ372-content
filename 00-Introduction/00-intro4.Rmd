# Quick Summary

Last class, I tried to answer two questions:

1. Why take this class?
2. What will we learn about?


???
For why? We talked a lot about high health care spending in the U.S. and how we don't really have great quality for such high spending (at least not great quality for an average person).

For what? We talked about how complicated the U.S. health care system is and how our privatized system introduces a ton of complicated incentives. This is the "big picture" economics of the class...studying some of these interesting incentives and how they play out in health care.

Now, let's go into more detail on "what" specifically we'll try to learn this semester, and "how" we'll try to learn it.

# Goals of this course

1. Explain the structure of the U.S. health care system, its main components, and its history
2. Model adverse selection in health insurance, examine its effects on health insurance markets, and support your arguments with existing data
3. Explain the physician agency problem, use a model of physician agency to examine financial incentives in health care, and summarize empirical evidence on the presence of physician agency
4. Describe hospital pricing, negotiation with insurers, and explain (qualitatively and quantitatively) the differences between charges and prices
5. Analyze hospital data in a real-life setting and predict effects of real-life policies


---
# Structure

Course designed to follow someone through our health care system.

1. Choose an insurance plan (so we'll study insurance and insurance markets)

2. Select a physician (so we'll study physician agency and financial incentives)

3. Receive hospital care (so we'll study hospital behaviors, pricing, and competition)

# Materials

- Check the website!
- I'll reference a couple of textbooks, but they aren't required
- All readings and supplemental materials listed on the content page of our class website

# Assignments

Assessment in 4 different ways:

1. Homework (3 assignments, 1 for each module)
2. Mid-term exam (covers modules 1-2)
3. Project (relates mainly to module 3 but is semester long)
4. Participation

# Expectations

- This is an <b>economics</b> class first

  - Nothing more than derivatives
  - For review, see the practice problems on the class resources page
